The idea of this project is to make the framework similar to Tosca.
Using selenium cucumber, we will read the requirements from the excel file, even the test case design in the excel file. 
Then we will design the test cases using selenium based on the parameters present in the excel file. After the execution,
the result will be displayed in the reporting tool.
